Column A : Second Number
Column B : The Device number ( there are 7 devices )
Column C : Locations which I got by Random Waypoint Model.
Column D : Signal Strength for the locations in Column C.
Column E:  Unrelated column, as it has signal strength and the co-ordinates, which I had used just for my clarification that                      for every row, signal strength is coming.
Column F : Locations I got programmatically, for Column C. 
 Note: Column D tells the signal strength for locations, which I got manually by standing there. Locations E tells   signal strength  which I got programmatically. 
Column G : Thus, the error between Column F and Column D. The Average Error for Signal Strength is : 3.09
Column H : The location points where I trained my Samsung Ace 2X device.
Column I :  Signal Strength for those training locations.
Column K: Second No.
Column L : From Random Waypoint Model, the devices whose distance is less than 4 m.
Column M : The distance which I got from Random Waypoint Model ( in m).
Column P : Distances between two Ipads in mt. I got this value from Beep Beep System.
Column Q : Actual Distance at which two Ipads where kept in cm(1-400)
